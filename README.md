# GPT3 Test

**TODO: A lot!**

Install the dependencies with ```mix deps.get``` before running any file.

Each module can only be run by invoking the ```start``` function with an input query.
Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/gpt3_test](https://hexdocs.pm/gpt3_test).
